      British rock band
      <a

        target="_blank"
        >Bring me the Horizon</a
      >. It was released on 1 April 2013 worldwide through RCA Records, a
      subsidiary label of Sony Music, and 2 April 2013 in the United States and
      Canada through Epitaph Records. It is the first album to feature former
      Worship keyboardist Jordan Fish and the first with guitarist Lee Malia
      playing both lead and rhythm components.

      Written and recorded throughout 2012, <em>Sempiternal</em> showed the band
      pull diverse influences from electronic music, ambient music and pop.
      "Sempiternal" is an archaic English word denoting the concept of
      "everlasting time" that can never actually come to pass. It stems from the
      Latin word "<a
        href="http://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/sempiternus"
        target="_blank"
        >sempiternus</a
      >" (a concatenation of root "semper" and suffix "aeternum").
      <br />
      <br />
      The album spawned four singles ("Shadow Moses"; "Sleepwalking"; "Go to
      Hell, for Heaven's Sake"; and "Can You Feel My Heart"). The album made its
      debut at No. 3 on the UK Album Chart and is their second successive album
      to top the ARIA Charts in Australia. It also managed to reach No. 11 on
      the US Billboard 200 with 27,522 first week sales, making Sempiternal the
      band's highest charting album in America until That's the Spirit debuted
      at No. 2 in 2015. Upon its release, the album received critical acclaim.
